  Use this skill when verifying that a new model is truly done and ready to
  merge. Provides a Definition-of-Done checklist covering all five test
  confidence levels (L1 graph build through L5 generation), faithful runtime
  metadata, optional downstream runtime probes, Olive quantization
  compatibility, multi-dtype (f32/f16/bf16) and multi-EP (CPU/CUDA/DML)
  correctness, documentation requirements, and code review criteria.

# Skill: Quality Checklist

## When to use

Use this checklist before marking a new model addition as **done**.
Every required item must be checked — or explicitly waived with a written
reason — before the PR is merged.

---

## The Checklist

### 1. Code quality

- [ ] Model file is in `src/mobius/models/` with the Microsoft MIT copyright
      header (`# Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. / # Licensed under the
      MIT License.`)
- [ ] Class has a descriptive one-paragraph docstring (first paragraph is
      used in generated docs)
- [ ] Class has `default_task` and `category` class-level attributes if
      the model is not a standard text-generation model
- [ ] `preprocess_weights()` correctly maps every HuggingFace state-dict key
      to the ONNX initializer name (verified by the weight-alignment test)
- [ ] Models/tasks import components from the public API; component submodules
      import sibling primitives directly to avoid package-init cycles
- [ ] No explicit protobuf operations anywhere in new code
      (`onnx.helper`, `onnx.TensorProto`, etc. are forbidden)
- [ ] Tensor shapes are annotated in comments after non-trivial operations
- [ ] Automated code review (Copilot/PR review) has been run and all
      findings are resolved or explicitly dismissed with a reason
- [ ] Run the CI formatter first (`lintrunner f --output oneline --all-files`),
      then `lintrunner -a`; confirm the pinned tools actually ran (an
      uninitialized/no-op lintrunner is not evidence)

### 2. L1 — Graph builds

- [ ] Entry exists in `tests/_test_configs.py` (or a dedicated test method
      for VLM / audio models)
- [ ] `is_representative=True` if the model has unique behaviour (custom
      class, special attention, MoE, hybrid layers, etc.)
- [ ] `python -m pytest tests/build_graph -k "<model_type>"` passes
- [ ] Weight-alignment test passes:
      `python -m pytest tests/weight_alignment_test.py -k "<model_type>"`

### 3. L2 — Config compatible

- [ ] YAML test case created at `testdata/cases/<category>/<model>.yaml`
- [ ] `test_model_id` field set to a real HuggingFace model ID
- [ ] Revision/trust flags are pinned and forwarded through config, processor,
      weights, golden generation, and CLI build
- [ ] Schema validates: `python -m pytest tests/yaml_schema_test.py`

### 4. L3 — Synthetic parity

- [ ] Model type is covered in `tests/synthetic_parity_test.py` (driven by
      `_test_configs.py`; added automatically for text-generation models)
- [ ] `python -m pytest tests/synthetic_parity_test.py -k "<model>"` passes
      with `atol=1e-3` / `rtol=1e-3` (or `1e-2` for multimodal)
- [ ] Real-weight parity also checked via a focused integration suite (add
      generic causal LMs to `TEXT_MODELS` in `tests/integration/_support.py`
      if a small checkpoint is available)

### 5. L4 — Golden match

- [ ] YAML test case has `level: "L4"` or `"L4+L5"`
- [ ] `inputs.prompts: ["Here is my poem:"]` (standard default prompt unless
      audio/image model)
- [ ] Golden file generated:
      `python scripts/generate_golden.py --level L4 --filter '<model>*'`
- [ ] Golden file committed to `testdata/golden/<cat>/<model>.json`
- [ ] `python -m pytest tests/e2e_golden_test.py -m golden -k "<model>"` passes

### 6. L5 — Generation verified

- [ ] YAML test case has `level: "L5"` or `"L4+L5"`
- [ ] `generation.max_new_tokens` set (≥ 20 recommended)
- [ ] `generation.do_sample: false` (deterministic greedy decode)
- [ ] Generation golden file generated:
      `python scripts/generate_golden.py --level L5 --filter '<model>*'`
- [ ] Generation golden file committed to
      `testdata/golden/<cat>/<model>_generation.json`
- [ ] `python -m pytest tests/e2e_golden_test.py -m generation -k "<model>"` passes
- [ ] Sequence length is asserted before exact token/frame comparison (no
      prefix-only `zip` comparison)

> **Speech-language models:** The golden generation script supports the
> `speech-language` task type for models that process audio inputs (e.g.,
> Gemma4). The `_generate_speech_language()` function in
> `scripts/generate_golden.py` handles audio feature extraction and input
> construction for these models. Ensure the correct feature extractor
> (e.g. `Gemma4AudioFeatureExtractor`, not `WhisperFeatureExtractor`) is
> auto-detected via `AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained()`.

> **Why L4/L5 matter:** Graph-build tests (L1) only verify ONNX graph
> construction; they never execute the graph with real data.  A MatMul shape
> mismatch that crashes at runtime, a wrong normalisation type, or a missing
> scaling multiplier can all pass L1 while producing completely wrong output.
> L4/L5 are the only tests that catch these classes of bugs.

### 7. Multi-dtype correctness

- [ ] Every claimed dtype runs real, nonzero input and checks semantic output,
      not merely export/session creation
- [ ] fp32 passes full-logit parity and deterministic semantic output
- [ ] fp16/bf16 pass full-logit parity (`atol=1e-2`) plus
      architecture-appropriate tokens, frame IDs, transcript, or image output
- [ ] A dtype that executes inaccurately is rejected explicitly and is not the
      default; never silently downgrade

Use the example `--compare-hf --dtype f16/bf16` flag if a comparison script
exists:

```bash
python examples/<model>_text_generation.py --compare-hf --dtype f16
python examples/<model>_text_generation.py --compare-hf --dtype bf16
```

### 8. CLI build

- [ ] `mobius build --model <hf-model-id> /tmp/out` completes without error
- [ ] Output directory contains the expected ONNX files and `genai_config.json`
- [ ] Multi-model tasks use standardised ModelPackage keys: `"decoder"`,
      `"vision_encoder"`, `"audio_encoder"`, `"embedding"` (not legacy names
      like `"model"`, `"vision"`, `"audio"`, or `"speech"`)
- [ ] Processor config uses correct filename: `image_processor.json` for
      all VLMs, `audio_processor.json` for audio

### 8a. Multi-EP correctness (CUDA)

- [ ] Model runs correctly with `--ep cuda` (or `--device cuda`)
- [ ] CUDA results match CPU results (compare generation output)
- [ ] No crashes from large tensor operations (see ORT Gather int32
      overflow: microsoft/onnxruntime#28107)
- [ ] No NaN from large head_dim > 256 (tracked in
      microsoft/onnxruntime#28195, #28196)
- [ ] `ort_lower_opset_for_ep` flag available for opset 24→23 lowering
      on older ORT builds (disabled by default in `src/mobius/_flags.py`,
      opt-in via `MOBIUS_ORT_LOWER_OPSET_FOR_EP=1`)
- [ ] Dead graph inputs removed after EP-aware optimization
      (`RemoveDeadGraphInputsPass` in Stage 4 of `optimize_model()`)
- [ ] Vision/audio graph inputs match the real processor (normally float32);
      reduced-precision encoders cast once at graph entry
- [ ] Representative graph evidence covers raw/post-Mobius/post-weight and
      ORT EP-optimized op histograms; verify critical fusions, unexpected
      Transpose nodes, and activation-vs-scalar metadata Memcpy nodes
- [ ] Final fusion claims use loaded weights/constants; no-weight graphs cannot
      prove initializer folding

### 9. ORT GenAI metadata and downstream runtime

- [ ] Generated metadata faithfully reflects graph filenames, semantic I/O,
      representable cache templates, and global cache-slot indices
- [ ] Intrinsic schema/config errors are tested without inferring downstream
      runtime capability

Downstream evidence:

- [ ] The network-free generic decoder test passes with the pinned latest stable
      `onnxruntime-genai==0.15.2`.
- [ ] Every runtime-supported real route has an `ort_genai` YAML marker with an
      immutable evidence ID, exact tokenizer provenance, bounded download size,
      CPU provider claim, and explicit released-version capabilities.
- [ ] Real generation asserts the full generated length before token equality
      and runs with an isolated Hub/Xet cache that is deleted after the test.
- [ ] If ORT GenAI validation is run for a model with dual head dimensions,
      determine whether that runtime requires
      `search.past_present_share_buffer=false` for its uniform KV-cache
      allocation, and override the generated config only for that probe.
- [ ] Add an ORT GenAI integration test when useful, but do not require one for
      export acceptance.

Omitting these downstream probes requires no waiver or TODO.


Waiver needed if any of the steps are not possible.

Run the ORT GenAI integration test:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ort_genai_e2e_test.py -m ort_genai_fast -v
python -m pytest tests/gguf_small_model_runtime_integration_test.py \
  -m ort_genai_real -v
```

### 10. Foundry Local package check

- [ ] `genai_config.json` and all ONNX files are present and internally
      consistent
- [ ] If Foundry Local is available, record its version and load/generation
      result as optional downstream evidence; limitations do not block export

### 11. Olive quantization compatibility

- [ ] Model can be loaded from the exported ONNX package by Olive
- [ ] INT4 / INT8 quantization runs to completion without errors
- [ ] Quantized model produces non-degenerate output (coherent text)
- [ ] Quantization uses only required execution providers if unrelated provider
      registration fails, and evidence includes size, load, and inference
- [ ] If quantization changes the graph structure (e.g. MatMulNBits), verify
      the `genai_config.json` still loads correctly in ORT GenAI

Run the quantization integration test suite to confirm existing patterns
are not broken:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/quantization_integration_test.py -v
```

For new architectures, add a quantized variant test if the architecture has
novel weight layouts (e.g. fused QKV, non-standard expert routing).

### 12. Documentation

- [ ] Class docstring (first paragraph) clearly describes the model family
      and the HuggingFace class it replicates
- [ ] `default_task` and `category` are set correctly (auto-generates the
      model page and index entry)
- [ ] If the model has a notable architectural difference from the base class,
      a comment in the source file or the skill notes explains it
- [ ] README model table updated if this is a significant new addition

### 13. Publication and CI triage

- [ ] Run specialist review after L1-L3, before expensive L4/L5, and again
      after optimization or rebase changes
- [ ] Rebase linearly onto `origin/main`; resolve shared registries/helpers
      semantically, run shared-surface tests, and push with `--force-with-lease`
- [ ] After rebase, rerun metadata generation and intrinsic config validation.
      If downstream runtime evidence is included, rerun that exact probe too.
- [ ] Confirm the remote PR head SHA, mergeability, replacement lint, and
      architecture checks after the final push
- [ ] Triage red CI at check/job/test granularity against the exact base SHA;
      record test names and metrics, and never change unrelated models
- [ ] For expensive GPU goldens, link targeted L4 and L5 jobs; aggregate
      timeout or runner failure is not model evidence

## Waiver policy

Any required item that cannot be completed must be waived explicitly in the PR
description:

```
**Waivers:**
- L5 golden: Model is 70B — generating golden data exceeds CI resources.
  skip_reason added to YAML.
```

Unchecked items without a waiver are grounds to request changes before merge.
