"""One serialized contract shape, for every package this producer can emit.

A package describes itself in exactly one place: ``pipeline.workflow``. That is
true of a three-graph vision-language package, and it is equally true of a bare
single-file decoder — the single-file case is a one-component workflow, not a
different kind of document with its own keys. A runtime is free to *lower* that
one component onto an optimized single-graph path; what it may not do is read a
second, independently writable statement of the same facts, because nothing
would force the two to agree and a reader of one never learns that the other
said something else.

These tests exist because that property is only worth anything if it cannot
quietly lapse. It would be easy for a feature added to one export shape — a
fixed-capacity cache, an FP8 buffer, a heterogeneous decoder — to grow its own
top-level block "just for this case", and easy for that to go unnoticed while
every feature-specific test kept passing. So the assertions here are
deliberately shape-agnostic: they are asked of dynamic, static-cache, FP8,
heterogeneous and composite packages through the same code path, and of every
checked-in fixture package, and none of them mentions a feature by name.
