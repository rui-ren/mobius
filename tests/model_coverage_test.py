"""Model test-coverage audit: every registered architecture must have L1-L5 data.

Replaces ``scripts/check_new_model_coverage.py`` and the CI workflow
``.github/workflows/model-coverage.yml`` which only checked *newly added*
models via ``git diff``.  This pytest checks **all** registered models on
every run, so coverage gaps cannot accumulate silently.

Coverage levels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

=====  ========  =====================================================
Level  Artefact  What it proves
=====  ========  =====================================================
L1     ``tests/_test_configs.py`` entry       Graph builds without error
L2     ``test_model_id`` in ``_registry.py``  HF config can be fetched
L3     (same as L1)                           Synthetic-parity forward pass
L4     YAML in ``testdata/cases/``            End-to-end test spec exists
L5     JSON in ``testdata/golden/``           Reference outputs available
=====  ========  =====================================================

Adding a new model?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Add a config to ``tests/_test_configs.py``  →  L1 + L3
2. Set ``test_model_id`` in ``_registry.py``   →  L2
3. Add YAML in ``testdata/cases/``             →  L4
4. Generate golden JSON (or add ``skip_reason`` to YAML)  →  L5

See ``.agents/skills/writing-tests/SKILL.md`` for the full guide.
