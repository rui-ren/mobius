"""GGUF → ONNX build pipeline.

Converts ``.gguf`` model files to ONNX using the standard build
pipeline. Quantized target storage is the default: affine linear-layer weights
are repacked into MatMulNBits format and compatible token embeddings into
GatherBlockQuantized format. For text-only builds, runtime-supported native
IQ/MXFP4 projection blocks are preserved for BlockQuantizedMatMul. Lossy
normalization to a common packed target is allowed only with a deterministic
warning and persistent fidelity report. Set
``keep_quantized=False`` to request a fully float import explicitly.

    1. Parse GGUF metadata → :class:`ArchitectureConfig`
    2. Look up the model class and task from the registry
    3. Build the ONNX graph (standard ``build_from_module`` pipeline)
    4. Map GGUF tensor names → HuggingFace names
    5. Replace native-block projection modules when present
    6. Apply architecture-specific tensor processors
    7. Run ``preprocess_weights()`` (HF → ONNX name mapping)
    8. Apply weights to the ONNX model

    By default, supported tensors use quantized target storage.
    For text-only builds, operator-native IQ/MXFP4 projection blocks
    are retained byte-for-byte for BlockQuantizedMatMul. Multimodal text
    backbones normalize quantized projections to their common affine target. GGUFs
    containing only F32, F16, or BF16 weights use the float path because there
    is no quantization to preserve.
    Quantized files with no supported preservation target raise an actionable
    error instead of silently falling back to a float model.

    Args:
        gguf_path: Path to a ``.gguf`` file or any member of a complete local
            split set, *or* a HuggingFace Hub
            reference of the form ``"owner/repo"`` (the repo must
            contain exactly one ``*.gguf`` file) or
            ``"owner/repo:filename.gguf"`` to pick a specific file. HF
            references are downloaded via ``huggingface_hub`` into the
            standard local cache. A selected Hub shard resolves every sibling
            at one immutable commit after a total-size/free-space preflight.
        task: Override the model task (e.g. ``"text-generation"``).
            When ``None``, the task is auto-detected from the
            model type.
        dtype: Override model dtype (e.g. ``"f16"``). When ``None``,
            defaults to float32.
        keep_quantized: Keep quantized target storage when supported. This is
            the default. Supported affine blocks are repacked,
            text-only runtime-supported native IQ/MXFP4 projection blocks
            retain their bytes, and incompatible source qtypes are explicitly
            classified as lossy dequantize/requantize conversions. This does not
            guarantee source-byte or source-value fidelity. Set to ``False`` to
            dequantize all weights to float.
        execution_provider: Target execution provider for EP-aware
            optimisations (e.g. ``"cpu"`` to apply the
            GroupQueryAttention rewrite). Defaults to ``"default"``
            (portable, no vendor fusions).
        mmproj: Optional path (or HF ref) to a companion ``clip``
            multimodal-projector GGUF. When set, this becomes the single
            entry point for a multimodal build: the text GGUF and the
            mmproj vision/audio encoder are fused into one multimodal
            :class:`ModelPackage` (delegates to
            :func:`build_gemma4_vlm_from_gguf`).
        image_token_id: Optional processor-owned image placeholder or sentinel
            ID for companion mmproj packages. It is forwarded unchanged; GGUF
            text vocabularies do not always serialize this processor contract.
        static_cache: When ``True``, build with a pre-allocated static KV
            cache (fixed-width buffers written in place via ``TensorScatter``)
            instead of the default dynamic concat-grow cache. Produces a
            fully static-shaped graph, which is required by fixed-shape
            runtimes such as the QNN HTP backend. Cannot be combined with an
            explicit *task* override.
        max_seq_len: Maximum sequence length for the static cache buffers.
            Only used when ``static_cache=True``. Defaults to the model's
            ``max_position_embeddings``.
        allow_dense_moe: Opt in to exporting routed MoE experts that have no
            sparse top-k fusion (they lower to per-expert native
            ``BlockQuantizedMatMul`` nodes, i.e. dense-all-expert compute with
            no performance guarantee). When ``None`` (default), the value of
            the ``allow_dense_moe_experts`` flag is used, which defaults to
            ``False`` — the build fails closed with a typed capability error
            rather than silently shipping a dense graph. This is a research /
            correctness knob and makes no throughput claim.
        reuse_gguf_weights: Reuse compatible tensor payloads directly from the
            original GGUF via ONNX external-data ranges. The GGUF must be a real
            file in the final flat output directory. Converted tensors are
            written once to ``model.onnx.data``.
        target_config: Exact target model directory, config path, or explicit
            config mapping for a ``dflash``/``eagle3`` speculative draft. A
            mapping must include the complete ``tokenizer_json`` object. Required for draft GGUFs
            and rejected for standalone architectures.
        output_layer_indices: Optional zero-based decoder layers to expose as
            ``hidden_states.{index}`` outputs. This is used by target-coupled
            draft packages and leaves ordinary decoder exports unchanged.

    Returns:
        A :class:`ModelPackage` containing the built model(s).

    Raises:
        ImportError: If the ``gguf`` package is not installed.
        FileNotFoundError: If the GGUF file does not exist.
        KeyError: If the GGUF architecture is not in the registry.
        ValueError: If *static_cache* is combined with an explicit *task*, or
            if a quantized input has no supported preservation target.

    """Normalize GGUF-specific weight shapes to match HF conventions.

    GGUF tensor mapping + dequantization produces weights that differ
    from HuggingFace in several ways. This function converts them so
    that ``preprocess_weights`` only needs to handle HF→ONNX mapping.

    Transforms applied:

    - **Stacked expert weights**: GGUF provides separate 3D tensors
      ``experts.{gate,up,down}_proj.weight`` with shape
      ``[num_experts, out, in]``. These are unpacked into per-expert
      ``experts.{i}.{proj}.weight`` tensors, matching the HF
      ``experts.down_proj`` format that ``preprocess_weights`` expects.
    - **1D shared_expert_gate**: GGUF stores as ``[hidden]``; HF/ONNX
      ``Linear(hidden, 1)`` expects ``[1, hidden]``.
    - **2D conv1d**: GGUF stores as ``[channels, kernel]``; depthwise
      ``Conv1d`` expects ``[channels, 1, kernel]``.
    - **dt_bias suffix**: GGUF ``ssm_dt.bias`` maps to
      ``dt_bias.bias`` after suffix splitting, but the model parameter
      is just ``dt_bias`` (an ``nn.Parameter``, not a module bias).
    - **DeltaNet A_log**: GGUF stores the SSM decay pre-transformed as
      ``ssm_a = -exp(A_log)``; mobius's ``GatedDeltaNet`` re-derives
      ``-exp(A_log)`` at runtime, so the raw log is recovered via
      ``A_log = log(-ssm_a)`` (scoped to ``linear_attn.A_log``).
    - **Zero-centered RMSNorm** (``gguf_arch`` in
      :data:`_OFFSET_NORM_GGUF_ARCHS`): the converter bakes ``+1`` into every
      ``*norm.weight`` except ``linear_attn.norm.weight``; mobius applies the
      ``1 +`` at runtime via :class:`OffsetRMSNorm`, so subtract ``1`` back out
      to avoid double-counting.
    - **Gated-DeltaNet V-head tiling** (``gguf_arch`` in
      :data:`_V_HEAD_REORDER_GGUF_ARCHS`, grouped linear attention): the
      converter reorders every V-indexed ``linear_attn`` tensor from HF grouped
      order into ggml tiled order; mobius consumes grouped order, so the tiling
      is undone via :func:`_reorder_deltanet_v_heads`.

    Args:
        state_dict: Dequantized GGUF weights keyed by HF tensor names.
        gguf_arch: The source GGUF architecture string (e.g. ``"qwen35"``),
            used to gate architecture-specific value transforms such as the
            zero-centered RMSNorm offset.
        config: The resolved :class:`ArchitectureConfig`; supplies the
            Gated-DeltaNet head counts / dims used to undo the V-head tiling.
