    """Adapt an already-selected (routing_weights, selected_experts) pair.

    (top-k-shaped, e.g. ``[..., top_k]``) into the full ``[..., num_experts]``
    ``(router_probs, router_weights)`` tensors QMoE requires.

    QMoE always performs its own top-k selection over ``router_probs``
    (governed by the ``k`` attribute); there is no ABI to hand it externally
    chosen expert indices directly. This matters for gates whose selection is
    not expressible as "top-k of a per-expert score", most notably hash-table
    routing (e.g. DeepSeek-V4's ``tid2eid`` lookup): the natural per-expert
    score used to pick a weight need not rank the selected experts above the
    rest, so passing it straight through as ``router_probs`` could make QMoE's
    internal top-k pick a *different* set of experts than the gate actually
    chose.

    This adapter sidesteps that by constructing ``router_probs`` as ``-inf``
    everywhere except a constant positive marker at exactly the selected
    positions: any of the ``top_k`` marked slots trivially outranks every
    ``-inf`` slot, so QMoE's internal top-k recovers precisely the selected
    expert set regardless of relative order among ties. ``router_weights`` is
    the real per-slot weight scattered at the same positions (zero
    elsewhere, never read since QMoE only gathers ``router_weights`` at its
    own top-k selection, which is exactly the scattered set). This changes
    neither the selection algorithm nor the weight values -- it only encodes
    an already-final ``(routing_weights, selected_experts)`` pair in the
    tensor shape QMoE's ABI requires, the same idea ``DeepSeekMoEGate``
    already uses (mask non-selected groups to ``-inf`` before ``TopK``).

    Requires ``routing_weights`` to be non-negative (true for softmax/
    sigmoid/sqrt-softplus scoring, the scoring functions used by every
    caller today) and ``normalize_routing_weights=0`` at the QMoE call site,
    since these weights are already final and must not be re-normalized.
    Also requires ``selected_experts`` to name ``top_k`` *distinct* experts
    per token: ``ScatterElements`` does not accumulate duplicate indices, so
    a repeated expert would silently drop one of its contributions. Every
    gate in this module (and DeepSeek-V4's hash table) already guarantees
    this -- top-k selection over a score tensor never repeats an index, and
    a hash table has no reason to route a token to the same expert twice.

    CPU-only correctness: ORT's CPU QMoE honors Input 14 (``router_weights``)
    by gathering it at the selected experts, but CUDA QMoE ignores Input 14
    and always derives weights by softmax-top-k over ``router_probs`` itself
    (see ``contrib_ops/cpu/moe/moe_quantization_cpu.cc`` vs
    ``contrib_ops/cuda/moe/moe_quantization.cc``). Unlike ``TopKGate``/
    ``SoftmaxTopKGate``/``SigmoidTopKGate`` above, whose selection score
    doubles as (a monotonic function of) the aggregation weight -- so raw
    logits can be passed as ``router_probs`` and CUDA's internal recompute
    reproduces ``forward()`` exactly -- callers of this adapter select
    experts by an index with no such relationship to a per-expert score
    (hash lookup, or a selection tensor that differs from the weighting
    tensor, e.g. DeepSeek noaux_tc-style bias-corrected top-k). There is no
    ``router_probs`` encoding that makes CUDA's forced internal recompute
    reproduce the correct weights in that case. This is the same limitation
    already present in ``DeepSeekMoEGate.qmoe_routing`` (V3) and is tracked
    upstream at https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/31570 (adds
    CUDA ``router_weights`` support). Until that lands, callers of this
    adapter are CPU-EP-correct only; do not execute on the CUDA EP.
